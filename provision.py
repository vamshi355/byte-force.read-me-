
# Load a pre-trained objecFirst, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can use the following commands to install the libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install opencv-python tensorflow pandas labelImg
Step 2: Load the Pre-Trained Model
We'll use TensorFlow's Object Detection API to load a pre-trained model and perform object detection.

python
Copy
import tensorflow as tf
import cv2
import numpy as np
t detection model
model = tf.saved_model.load("ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco/saved_model")

# Function to run the model on an image and get predictions
def run_inference_for_single_image(model, image):
    # Convert the image to a tensor and run inference
    image_np = np.array(image)
    input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(image_np)
    input_tensor = input_tensor[tf.newaxis,...]
    
    # Run the inference
    detections = model(input_tensor)
    return detections
Step 3: Pre-process Input Image and Run Object Detection
Next, we will load the input image, preprocess it, and use the model to detect objects in the image.

python
Copy
def load_image_into_numpy_array(path):
    return np.array(cv2.imread(path))

# Path to your image
image_path = "image.jpg"
image_np = load_image_into_numpy_array(image_path)

# Run inference on the image
detections = run_inference_for_single_image(model, image_np)

# Get detected boxes, classes, and scores
boxes = detections['detection_boxes'].numpy()
classes = detections['detection_classes'].numpy().astype(np.int32)
scores = detections['detection_scores'].numpy()

# Visualize the results (bounding boxes on the image)
for i in range(len(boxes)):
    if scores[i] > 0.5:  # Show only those with a score > 0.5
        box = boxes[i]
        class_id = classes[i]
        score = scores[i]
        
        # Draw bounding boxes on the image
        ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax = box
        xmin = int(xmin * image_np.shape[1])
        xmax = int(xmax * image_np.shape[1])
        ymin = int(ymin * image_np.shape[0])
        ymax = int(ymax * image_np.shape[0])

        cv2.rectangle(image_np, (xmin, ymin), (xmax, ymax), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Save the image with annotations
cv2.imwrite('annotated_image.jpg', image_np)
Step 4: Manual Annotation Using LabelImg
For manual annotations, we can use LabelImg, a graphical image annotation tool. You can install it with:

bash
Copy
pip install labelImg
Then, open LabelImg and manually annotate your images by drawing bounding boxes around objects. After saving, youâ€™ll get an XML file in Pascal VOC format, which can later be used to train models.

Step 5: Combine Automatic and Manual Annotations
Once you have both automatically generated and manually labeled annotations (from LabelImg), you can combine these annotations and use them for model
